<h2 id="best-heroes">Best Heroes</h2>

<p>What heroes are great? What heroes should I work on? Nobody knows yet. The game is too new to know. So for now they are all great so pick one you like and gets you excited to play. If you can’t decide, a good strategy is to work on Dean, Gwen, Claire, and JaeglWoon since these are your starter heroes and there seems to be plenty of hero pieces for them to help you upgrade, and these heroes are great.</p>

<p>Now with that said, if you can score a hero specific weapon in the early-mid game, that hero will have significant strength over your other heroes. So I would use that hero to carry you through missions. You can get hero specific weapons through the daily free summon shop, or from crafting.</p>

<p>In fact what most high level players use is the hero they have the best gear for. You can get them some pretty sweet gear in the summon shop, using crystals to summon a 10 pack. And if you</p>

<p>So the best heroes are simply the ones you put the most effort into. The better equipment, higher level, most evolved heroes will do much better than heroes with significantly less combat power. And in the late game it’s really hard to max a hero out to max level and max gear. There’s always a little more you can do. So really, find ones you love their style and gameplay and choose them to gear up on and they’ll be great.</p>

<p>It’s a significant investment to get a hero all the way to awakened 1. So play around with a bunch at 4 or 5 star to see how they fair and if you like them enough to invest in them.</p>

<p>You can browse the top combat rated heroes in the game by going to Hero &gt; Hero Book &gt; Rank. From here you can sometimes click on the little “i” button in the bottom left to see their equipment, skills, and stats. This is fun to snoop on top players to see how they set up their character. It’s also a handy way to look at heroes you don’t have to see their skills.</p>

<h2 id="squad">Squad</h2>

<p>At first your squad will consist of 3 people. So pick a tank, someone who can heal, and a damage dealer.</p>

<p>Later on your squad will consist of 5 people. Again it’s crucial to have a tank, healer, and damage dealer, but the other 2 members is really up to you. Pick 2 more damage dealers for a quick fight. Pick a secondary tank to off tank some of the additional enemies, pick a support person, doesn’t matter. Find someone cool and throw them in.</p>

<p>You might wonder “Do I need more than 5 heroes?” Ya you do. Here’s some reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Later on you get a chance to have your spare heroes join you in battles called “interrupt”. It’s nice to have good solid heroes that will really help you clear levels quick.</li>
  <li>There’s a challenge called <code class="highlighter-rouge">blitz</code> but it only let’s you clear a level once per team. But you can make 3 squads and each squad can do the level. So you need 15 heroes to finish your blitz level if you want to do that.</li>
  <li><a href="/elchronicle-alchemy/">Alchemy</a> takes up a ton of heroes so the more you have the better there.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you might as well go nuts and recruit every hero from the Inn when you get a chance. Don’t worry about bad heroes interrupting your adventures. First I’ve noticed that the top heroes join in on those interrupts, not level 1s. Second, there’s more benefits to having a bunch of heroes.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-heroes">Types of Heroes</h2>

<p>There are 4 types of heroes. Warrior, DPS (Assassins), Supporter, and Specialist. Warriors are tanks, they are who you want to get hit during battle as they should have a lot of HP and def. Assassins are going to do the most damage, taking down targets quickly. And Supporters and Specialists are a mix. They might be healers, buffers, offensive tanks, or some mix of that.</p>

<h4 id="tanks">Tanks</h4>

<p>There are two types of tanks, offensive and defensive. The offensive one can take a lot of blows but have a high damage output. The defensive ones can take a lot more damage without a problem but don’t put out as much damage.</p>

<p>Tanks also generate a high amount of aggro keeping the enemies on them and not on assassins or healers.</p>

<p>Defensive Tanks:</p>

<div class="parent">	
	<div class="column">Dean<br /> <img src="/public/images/dean.jpg" alt="Dean" /></div>
	<div class="column">Richard<br /> <img src="/public/images/richard.jpg" alt="Richard" /></div>
	<div class="column">Mubu<br /> <img src="/public/images/mubu.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Markon<br /> <img src="/public/images/markon.jpg" /></div>
</div>

<div class="parent">	
	<div class="column">PaengGeumbo<br /> <img src="/public/images/paenggeumbo.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Jango<br /> <img src="/public/images/jango.jpg" /></div>	
	<div class="column">Reinhardt<br /> <img src="/public/images/reinhardt.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
</div>

<p>Offensive Tanks:</p>

<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">AhkChungwang<br /> <img src="/public/images/ahkchungwang.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Kael<br /> <img src="/public/images/kael.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">BaekLicheon<br /> <img src="/public/images/baeklicheon.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Grace<br /> <img src="/public/images/grace.jpg" /></div>
</div>

<p>It’s not clear who the best tanks are. Each are built pretty well. So find one you think looks cool has fun skills and is exciting to play. I personally like sticking with Dean since his hero pieces are more available in the game than other tanks.</p>

<h4 id="assassins">Assassins</h4>

<p>There are two types of assassins, ranged and melee.</p>

<p>Ranged assassins:</p>

<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">Gwen<br /> <img src="/public/images/gwen.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Jade<br /> <img src="/public/images/jade.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Isha<br /> <img src="/public/images/isha.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Julia<br /> <img src="/public/images/julia.jpg" /></div>
</div>
<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">MaSeolin<br /> <img src="/public/images/maseolin.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
</div>

<p>Melee assassins:</p>

<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">Lily<br /> <img src="/public/images/lily.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Wolyung<br /> <img src="/public/images/wolyung.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">JaegalWoon<br /> <img src="/public/images/jaegalwoon.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Varia<br /> <img src="/public/images/varia.jpg" /></div>
</div>

<p>I think Ranged dealers have a slight advantage. They stay out of combat range which keeps them alive longer. They can switch targets quickly without having to run over to the new target. And they can continue to deal damage when the enemy is doing some kind of AOE attack and the melee units have to run away for a second. However I have also seen solid melee dealers completely out damage a ranged dealer. For the most part a melee dealer will stay out of any AOE damage, and not take aggro from a tank.</p>

<h4 id="supporters--specialists">Supporters &amp; Specialists</h4>

<p>Honestly I can’t tell the difference between supporters and specialists. Healers appear in both classes, DPS’ers appear in both classes, and buffers appear in both classes. I can’t find any clear thing that seperates the two other than their classification. There’s even a offensive tanker here what!?</p>

<p>Supporters:</p>

<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">LeeJiyeon (defensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/leejiyeon.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Dice (defensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/dice.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Claire (offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/claire.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Aaren (defensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/aaren.jpg" /></div>
</div>
<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">YeryungSuhwa (defensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/yeryungsuhwa.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">HwangBopae (offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/hwangbopae.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
</div>

<p>Specialists:</p>

<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">Iri<br />(offensive tanker)<br /> <img src="/public/images/iri.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Scarlett<br />(offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/scarlett.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Occasio<br />(offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/occasio.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Maeho<br />(offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/maeho.jpg" /></div>
</div>
<div class="parent">
	<div class="column">Aqua<br />(offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/aqua.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">Yeonhwa<br />(defensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/yeonhwa.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column">JaegalMageon<br />(offensive support)<br /> <img src="/public/images/jaegalmageon.jpg" /></div>
	<div class="column"></div>
</div>

<p>The <strong>offensive supporter</strong> heros will be good damage dealers and maybe even buff the team to improve damage even more.</p>

<p>The <strong>defensive supporters</strong> often will heal or have defensive buffs for the party such as increased defense or hp.</p>

<h2 id="who-to-focus-on">Who to Focus On</h2>

<p>When deciding who to upgrade or give that nice equipment to here is a general guide. First upgrade your <code class="highlighter-rouge">tank</code>. They really do keep the team alive and if they fall the whole team falls. But if your DPS falls you can still make it through many missions. The main tank should be the buffest one in your squad and consider crafting a hero specific weapon for them.</p>

<p>After your tank is good, improve your <code class="highlighter-rouge">assassin</code>. After that upgrade your <code class="highlighter-rouge">healer</code>. After that upgrade your <code class="highlighter-rouge">specialists</code>.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>Before you can Evolve a hero you have to upgrade them to the max. To upgrade a hero you need hero pieces. These can be acquired through adventuring, achievements, or bought in a shop.</p>

<p>Under your hero, click upgrade. If you have enough pieces and gold you can upgrade them. Each +1 they are upgraded their base stats rise and they become buffer.</p>

<p>A quick way to get a bunch of hero pieces is to complete that heroes challenges. Go to Event &gt; Achievement &gt; Challenge and select the hero. Here you will see a bunch of quests for them to do which rewards you with hero pieces.</p>

<h2 id="evolving">Evolving</h2>

<p>A hero starts at 1 star and can evolve to 6 stars. It is expensive to evolve a hero so look at what items are needed and think about farming those items and saving them up.</p>

<p>When a hero is evolved to the next star they gain in base stats. They also unlock new things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 stars - gain 1st passive skill</li>
  <li>3 stars - gain 1st trait</li>
  <li>4 stars - gain 2nd passive skill</li>
  <li>5 stars - gain 2nd trait, get new outfit</li>
  <li>6 stars - gain 3rd passive skill</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vines</strong> and <strong>Tearblooms</strong> are farmable from many of the adventure missions. The other ingredients are farmable in later missions but only will allow you to do it a few times a day. You may also get ingredients from the challenge missions. Stock up on all ingredients because upgrading is really expensive.</p>

<h2 id="awakening">Awakening</h2>

<p>After a hero reaches 6 stars they can be awakened. There are 3 stages to awakening W1, W2, and W3. This is extremely expensive to accomplish and will take quite a while. But awakened heroes will gain more in base stats, be allowed to level higher (up to 80), and open more abilities.</p>

<h2 id="hero-challenges">Hero Challenges</h2>

<p>A great way to get upgrade pieces for heroes is to do the Hero Challenges. you Can find this under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Event</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Achievement</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Challenges</code> menu. You can earn hundreds of hero pieces, hundreds of thousands of gold, and tons of upgrade materials. In this is such a great place that whenever I get a new hero from the Inn I’ll run them through 3 or 4 challenges to quickly get them starred up. A few quick exp potions a suit of armor and they are ready to join the squad.</p>

<h2 id="side-quests">Side Quests</h2>

<p>Side quests allow you to learn more about how to use your hero and their history while earning some helpful items.</p>

<p>As of Jun 11 2019 heroes in the side quest are fully upgraded with max equipment. They are not dependent on your actual heroes skill or level. So feel free to run these quests whenever they open up because it’s the same difficulty and reward no matter what level your heroes are.</p>

<p>Find the side quests at Inn &gt; Request Center &gt; Side Story.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>See the guide on <a href="/elchronicle-equipment/">equipment</a> to equip your heroes.</p>
