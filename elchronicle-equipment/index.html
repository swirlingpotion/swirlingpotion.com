  <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2019</span>
  <p>Random tips, ideas, and strategies about the equipment in El Chronicle.</p>

<p>Equipment as obtained from rewards in battle, raiding, doing challenges, completing requests, crafting, and the shop.</p>

<p>A hero has 6 equipment slots: <code class="highlighter-rouge">helmet</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">breastplate</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">shield/boots</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">hero specific weapon</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">normal weapon</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">normal accessory</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">treasure accessory</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">hero specific treasure accessory</code>.</p>

<p>Teasure accessories are obtainable when you get to raid hunter level 18.</p>

<p>Additionally a hero can wear <code class="highlighter-rouge">runes</code>. There are also <code class="highlighter-rouge">hero specific runes</code> that can only be used by a specific hero.</p>

<h2 id="tiers">Tiers</h2>

<p>There are 6 tiers of equipment. T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7.</p>

<table>
<tr><td><strong>Tier</strong></td><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Quality</strong></td><td><strong>Max Lvl</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>T1</td><td>Gray</td><td>Poor</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>T2</td><td>Green</td><td>Common</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>T3</td><td>Blue</td><td>Rare</td><td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>T4</td><td>Purple</td><td>Epic</td><td>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>T5</td><td>Orange</td><td>Legendary</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>T6</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Legendary</td><td>60</td></tr>
<tr><td>T7</td><td>White</td><td>Artifact</td><td>70</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The higher the tier the higher quality the item is. It will have higher stats, higher maximum level to upgrade it to, more stats to unlock as you upgrade etc.</p>

<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>

<p>Equipment (weapons, armor, accessories, runes) all have a grade which may be <code class="highlighter-rouge">D</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">SS</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">SS</code> is the highest grade, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">D</code> is the lowest. That is if you have 2 of the exact same item one having SS grade and 1 having F grade, the SS grade item will have more stats than the other.</p>

<p>Equipment will randomly be given a grade upon acquiring it. It’s random. Doesn’t matter on level or anything else when crafting it.</p>

<p>It’s possible to increase the grade but it’s very expensive. To increase the grade you need to <a href="https://global.elchronicle.io/archives/4042"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Transcend</code></a> the item 3 times.</p>

<h2 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h2>

<p>Equipment can be upgraded in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Workshop</code>. When an item is upgrade to level <code class="highlighter-rouge">11</code> it will gain a bonus stat. When an item is upgraded to level <code class="highlighter-rouge">21</code> it will gain another bonus stat. T1 items cannot gain a bonus stat. A bonus stat is whole new effect the item provides such as HP or +DEF. Because of these bonus stats it’s good to try to upgrade equipment to level 11 or 21 to get these bonus stats.</p>

<p>You upgrade armor by using other armor you aren’t using or an <code class="highlighter-rouge">upgrade stone</code>. There are 3 types of <code class="highlighter-rouge">upgrade stones</code>: low, medium and high. Upgrade stones can be created through <a href="/elchronicle-alchemy/">alchemy</a>, or acquired through adventuring in the game. So with old equipment that you won’t use, especially T1 equipment, you can use it to upgrade the good equipment you have. This is preferred since the only other option is to sell it and it’s fairly easy to acquire gold in the game.</p>

<h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>

<p>T4 equipment can hold you over well into the late game. It’s very hard and you have to be very lucky to get T6 items. So if you acquire a T4 item, you can safely invest in upgrading it even if you are a lower level.</p>

<p>T1-T3 cannot be Tiered up. But a T4 item can be increased to T5, T6 and T7. So again, if you find a good T4 item, upgrade it without worry.</p>

<p>Check your bags in the consumables section. You sometimes get chests that contains equipment and you have to open them there. There’s no difference in opening these chests when you’re low level or high, so open em when you get em.</p>

<p>When a piece of equipment is flashing it means it’s got bonus stats for that specific hero.</p>

<h2 id="farming--gearing-up">Farming / Gearing up</h2>

<p>Raids are a great way to get some decent gear. You can get T4 stuff to drop in there and you can even see which raids drop what before doing the raid.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to save up crystal and go to the summon shop to summon 10x cards. This summon can pull T3, T4, and T6 equipment and runes. This is a great way to gear up a hero.</p>

<p>You can also save up your honor and buy a T4 summon chest in the honor shop. This will contain a random T4 item. You can also buy ancient rune chests which will summon a random rune specific for a hero. Since the summon card pulls also grant this, it’s probably best to save your honor for upgrade materials.</p>

<p>Or with some Alchemy, and some raiding to get raid points for the shop, and adventuring to get ingredients, you can craft some equipment.</p>

<h2 id="crafting">Crafting</h2>

<p>Equipment can be crafted in the workshop. Armor, weapons, and accessories are fairly common to acquire while adventuring. But what isn’t so common is to see hero specific weapons drop. So it’s a good idea to craft these.</p>

<p>It’s safe to craft items at any point in the game as your level has no affect on the quality of equipment you craft.</p>

<p>Crafting a hero specific weapon is a great way to increase the hero’s power another 2,000 points pretty quick. Hero’s have 2 weapons, a general weapon and a hero specific weapon. When looking at the hero’s equipment, the slot in the bottom left corner is exclusive for hero specific weapons.</p>

<p>To craft a hero specific weapon you will need <code class="highlighter-rouge">100 hero pieces</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">5x Essence</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">4 monster ingredients</code>. The essence can be created through <a href="/elchronicle-alchemy/">alchemy</a>, and the monster ingredients are all sold in the raid shop and will cost you around 100k raid points to buy it all. The raid shop is the only place you can acquire these monster ingredients so saving you raid points for crafting is a good strategy.</p>

<p>It’s also a good strategy to craft a hero specific weapon early in the game as it’ll help you get through a large part of the game and carry you well into the late game. Heroes with their own weapon perform significantly better than those without it.</p>

<h2 id="transcend">Transcend</h2>

<p>If at some point you get a duplicate weapon or piece of armor or even rune you can choose to transcend it. By combining the two items together your item may get a bonus stat if transcended. If it fails your item will gain mileage which will allow you to transcend it after a certain mileage has been gained.</p>
